# Module 2 â€“ AWS Compute Services

This module gives an overview of key AWS services used to run applications and workloads.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- Virtual servers in the cloud
- Provides scalable and flexible computing capacity
- Choose EC2 instances based on:
  - CPU power
  - Memory
  - Storage
  - Networking

---

## ðŸ”¹ EC2 Pricing Models

- **On-Demand** â€“ Pay only when used (flexible, no commitment)
- **Reserved Instances** â€“ 1â€“3 year commitment, lower cost
- **Spot Instances** â€“ Use spare AWS capacity at reduced cost

---

## ðŸ”¹ EC2 Auto Scaling

- Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on traffic
- Helps maintain high availability and optimize cost

---

## ðŸ”¹ Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- Improves fault tolerance and availability

---

## ðŸ”¹ AWS Lambda

- Serverless computing â€“ runs code without managing servers
- Trigger-based: runs in response to events like file uploads or API calls
- Great for automation, quick deployments, and microservices

---

## ðŸ”¹ Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- Runs containerized applications (like Docker)
- Helps manage and scale containers easily

---

## ðŸ”¹ Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

- Messaging service for alerts/notifications via SMS, email, push
- Used for sending messages to users or apps

---

## ðŸ”¹ Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

- Message queuing service
- Decouples app components
- Ensures messages are stored and processed reliably

---

## ðŸ§ª Practice Resources

- AWS provides step-by-step labs and tutorials
- Perfect for beginners and hands-on learners

---

## âœ… Conclusion

This module introduced the compute tools that power AWS workloads, including EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling, ELB, SNS, and SQS. You also explored pricing models and the benefits of scalability and fault tolerance.
