Module 1 â€“ Introduction to AWS & Cloud Basics

ðŸ”¹ How AWS Started:
- Amazon needed better IT infrastructure for their e-commerce site in early 2000s.
- In 2003, they realized other companies might benefit from renting compute and storage.
- AWS launched in 2004 with Simple Queue Service.
- Then came S3 (storage) and EC2 (compute) in 2006.
- Today, AWS supports millions of customers globally.

ðŸ”¹ What is Cloud Computing?
- On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Examples: Store files in S3, run apps on EC2, analyze data remotely.

ðŸ”¹ Data Centers & Infrastructure:
- Data centers house servers and infrastructure.
- Before AWS, businesses built or rented their own.
- AWS allows companies to use their global data centers instead of maintaining their own.

ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Cloud Computing:
1. **Pay as you go** â€“ No need for huge upfront costs.
2. **Massive economies of scale** â€“ AWS buys hardware in bulk, lowers costs.
3. **Stop guessing capacity** â€“ Easily scale up/down based on demand.
4. **Speed & agility** â€“ Quickly test, build, and delete resources.
5. **No need to manage data centers** â€“ AWS handles the physical infrastructure.
6. **Go global in minutes** â€“ Deploy apps close to users in any region.

ðŸ”¹ AWS Global Infrastructure:
- AWS is built for **high availability and fault tolerance**.
- If one system fails, another is ready to take over.
- AWS Regions = Geographic areas (e.g., Ohio, Tokyo, Mumbai).
- Each Region has multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)** with redundant power/networking.
- Businesses often deploy in multiple Regions for backup/disaster recovery.

ðŸ”¹ AWS Shared Responsibility Model:
- Security is a **shared responsibility** between AWS and you (the customer).
- AWS secures the cloud (physical hardware, networking).
- You secure what's in the cloud (OS, apps, data, access control).
- Think of it like a house: AWS builds it, you lock the doors.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Example (E-Commerce Company):
- Use AWS Regions to host apps closer to customers (low latency).
- Use multiple AZs for high availability.
- Use Shared Responsibility Model to focus on securing data and apps while AWS handles infrastructure.

Conclusion:
This module explained the foundation of cloud computing, AWS's origin, core benefits, and how global infrastructure and shared responsibility enable secure, scalable business solutions.
