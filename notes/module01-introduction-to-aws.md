# Module 1 â€“ Introduction to AWS & Cloud Basics

---

## ðŸ”¹ How AWS Started

- Amazon needed better IT infrastructure for their e-commerce site in early 2000s.
- In 2003, they realized other companies might benefit from renting compute and storage.
- AWS launched in 2004 with Simple Queue Service.
- Then came S3 (storage) and EC2 (compute) in 2006.
- Today, AWS supports millions of customers globally.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is Cloud Computing?

- On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Examples: Store files in S3, run apps on EC2, analyze data remotely.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Data Centers & Infrastructure

- Data centers house servers and infrastructure.
- Before AWS, businesses built or rented their own.
- AWS allows companies to use their global data centers instead of maintaining their own.

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. **Pay as you go** â€“ No need for huge upfront costs.
2. **Massive economies of scale** â€“ AWS buys hardware in bulk, lowers costs.
3. **Stop guessing capacity** â€“ Easily scale up/down on demand.
4. **Speed & agility** â€“ Quickly test, build, and delete resources.
5. **No need to manage data centers** â€“ AWS handles the physical infrastructure.
6. **Go global in minutes** â€“ Deploy apps close to users in any region.

## ðŸ”¹ AWS Global Infrastructure

- Built for **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.
- **Regions** are global locations like Ohio, Mumbai, Paris, etc.
- Each Region has multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)** for redundancy.
- AZs have independent power, networking, and security.
- Businesses often use **multiple Regions** for backup & failover.

---

## ðŸ”¹ AWS Shared Responsibility Model

- **Security of the cloud** â†’ AWS responsibility (hardware, network)
- **Security in the cloud** â†’ Your responsibility (OS, apps, data)
- Think of AWS as building the house â€” you lock the doors.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Example (E-Commerce Company)

- Host apps near users using AWS Regions (low latency)
- Use multiple AZs for high availability
- Focus on securing apps and data â€” AWS handles physical security

## âœ… Conclusion

This module explained the foundation of cloud computing, AWS's origin, core benefits, global infrastructure, and how shared responsibility enables secure and scalable applications.
