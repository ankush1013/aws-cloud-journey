Module 2 â€“ AWS Compute Services

This module gives an overview of key AWS services used to run applications and workloads.

---

ðŸ”¹ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Virtual servers in the cloud
- Provides scalable and flexible computing capacity
- You can choose different types of EC2 instances based on:
  - CPU power
  - Memory
  - Storage
  - Networking

ðŸ”¹ EC2 Pricing Models
- **On-Demand** â€“ Pay only when you use (no long-term commitment)
- **Reserved Instances** â€“ Commit for 1 or 3 years, get discounted rates
- **Spot Instances** â€“ Use unused EC2 capacity at a lower price (for flexible workloads)

ðŸ”¹ EC2 Auto Scaling
- Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on demand
- Helps keep applications available and cost-efficient

ðŸ”¹ Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- Improves fault tolerance and high availability

---

ðŸ”¹ AWS Lambda
- Runs your code without provisioning or managing servers
- Event-driven: runs automatically in response to triggers (e.g., S3 upload, API Gateway)
- Good for microservices, automation tasks, real-time file processing

ðŸ”¹ Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- Helps run containerized applications (like Docker)
- Useful for managing, scaling, and deploying containers easily

---

ðŸ”¹ Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)
- Messaging service for sending alerts and notifications
- Works with SMS, email, mobile push, or other applications

ðŸ”¹ Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
- Message queuing system that helps decouple app components
- Ensures reliable storage, delivery, and processing of messages

---

ðŸ§ª Hands-On Practice Available
- AWS offers beginner-friendly tutorials and labs to practice compute services
- These tutorials guide you step-by-step and are ideal if youâ€™re new to cloud computing

âœ… Conclusion:
This module introduced various AWS compute services like EC2, Lambda, ECS, and messaging tools like SNS and SQS. You also learned about pricing models, scaling, and how these services support high availability and cost optimization in real-world applications.
